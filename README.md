# ZomboidAssetConverter

It's not user friendly as of current, so this documentation is going to be really brief. It is originally meant to be strictly cli-only, and is still going to be the case in the next release.

## Usage

- The assets (.X) you want to convert: (`in/assets/SomeAsset.X` ...)
- Press `Fix All` and wait for console to stop logging.
- Press `Dump All` and wait for console to stop logging.
- The assets (.GLTF) you receive reside here: (`out/assets/SomeAsset.gltf` ...)
